### Laravel 5.2 Self-Consuming Public API With Multiple Subdomains and Vue.js

This project is a modification of my original 
[Laravel 5.2 Self-Consuming API](https://github.com/dojorob76/laravel-5-2-self-consuming-api) starter app which is 
built on the [Laravel 5.2](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/releases#laravel-5.2) platform, and incorporates the 
[Dingo API](https://github.com/dingo/api), [JWT Auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth), 
[Bouncer](https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer) and [CORS](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-cors) packages.

This version is modified to include and make use of [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) along with 
[Vue Resource](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-resource), [Vue-Strap](https://yuche.github.io/vue-strap/), and 
[Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex).

Documentation is currently under construction, and will be available soon on the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/dojorob76/laravel-5-2-self-consuming-api/wiki).
